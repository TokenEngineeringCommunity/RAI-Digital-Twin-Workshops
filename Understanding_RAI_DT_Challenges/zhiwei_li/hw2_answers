Q1:Can you plot the data used for historical backtesting / future extrapolation on a separate Jupyter notebook?
-- Yes, see the notebook

Q2: What happens if you modify the `data/controller_params.csv` file? For instance, what happens if the simulation is ran with non-zero values on `ki` and `leaky_factor`? Or make kp go up or down?
-- When ki and leaky_factor are positive, then the redemption price significantly decreases towards zero; when kp goes up (4E5), 

Q3: Are you able to modify the existing notebook template? What if we print summary statistics like the average Redemption Price over all the trajectory?
-- Yes, see the notebook for a code example (Very rough...)

Q4: Are you able to create a new notebook template that gets generated on each run? 
-- Not sure how to do it.
